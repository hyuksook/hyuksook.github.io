I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ecs.sogang.ac.kr/ecs/index_new.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> of <a href="http://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sogang University</a>, where I am advised by <a href="http://fml.sogang.ac.kr/">Professor Saejoon Kim</a>. I received an MS in electrical engineering from <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> and a BS in electronic engineering from Sogang University.

My current research interests lie in machine learning and quantitative finance.
